<h1 style="font-family:AR CHRISTY;">TICK'S LIFE</h1>
<p>We are sorry to tell you that your mother died at birth. You are a baby female tick, 
just hatched from egg to a larva, alone in a big world. It is summertime and you are in a forest. 
The grass around you is long and green and you can feel the smell of the sea. While observing 
the scenery, you' re hit with a sudden feeling of hunger running through your body. Blood!</p>
<p>You are now in an insular landscape. You can see the shore. The ground is rocky and grassy.
Several leafy trees growing around...</p>

<p>Your command: <p>
