<h2>Tick Life Cycle</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="column left" style="background-color:#ffffe6;">
    <h2>Blood meal</h2>
    <p>
Ticks live on blood and nothing but blood. Ticks not only extract blood, they ooze pathogens from their
 salivary glands into the wound they've sliced with their tiny claws and penetrated with their barbed
  mouthparts. Undisturbed, a tick could happily sup for up to a week.</p>
<p>The tick's life is simple, fairly boring, but urgent. No host, no blood meal, and the tick dies. 
There's only one blood meal for each of the three stages of a tick's life - larva, nymph, and adult.
<p>
Ticks don't find the prey by sight; they have no eyes. On the tips of their front legs they have sensors,
 the Haller's organs, that allow them to detect the heat given off by warm-blooded animals.</p>
<p>Ticks can't jump, so they must find ways to attach to their hosts. They will use blades of grass 
and other vegetation to elevate themselves to the height where they can easily grasp onto passing animals.
Proximate biochemical signals, such as rising carbon dioxide levels emitted by a warm blooded mammal, 
alert the ticks to passing hosts.</p>

    <h2>Hibernation and molting</h2>
    <p><p>After filling with blood over several days, the ticks fall to the ground again, where they molt 
and become eight-legged nymphs. Ticks survive the winter months by going dormant. They hide in the leaf 
litter. When snow falls, it only serves to insulate the dormant ticks, which are protected by the 
layer of debris.</p>
<p>The nymphs prefer a larger animal as a host, such as a raccoon or possum. Following engorgement, 
nymphs drop to the ground where they molt yet again to finally become adult ticks. The adult ticks 
then go on a hunt for a third, even larger host, such as a deer or dog, where they are able to feed 
and then breed, resulting in reproduction.</p>

    <h2>Impregnation and egg laying</h2>
    <p>The male adult tick expands his repertoire to include finding females. Male and female engage 
in an impressive combination of gourmandise and lust. Maybe not lust exactly; for the female, 
it's more like being interrupted at breakfast by the UPS guy, with a package of perishables. 
Here's the setup: The female has her hypostome planted in the prey, imbibing. A long meal is the cue 
to her body to produce her 2,000 or so eggs. The male approaches from below, then uses his mouthparts 
to pluck a packet of sperm called a spermatophore from his genital pore. He delivers the packet into 
his partner's genital pore. The male frequently remains attached, mouthparts locked in the female 
genital aperture.</p>
<p>After the female drops to the ground, full of blood and sperm, she lays her eggs, and then 
the fun is definitely over. She begins to atrophy. Death for the tick comes from starvation, dehydration,
 egg-laying, or old age, rather than from predation.</p>
