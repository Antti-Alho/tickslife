    <h2>Description</h2>
    
<p>GroupFive is a group of engineering students founded in March 2018 by amateur creators Antti Alho, 
Joonatan Hämäläinen and Merja Leisti. The group was established based upon a shared force 
of making involuntary schoolworks. These students leverage their collective experience and complementary skills. 
Tick’s Life, a weird text adventure game, is the group’s first project.<p/> 

<p>About the Founders: Antti is best known as a github authority and highly experienced programmer. 
Joonatan is a multifaceted programmer with additional abilities in wide fields of game design. 
Merja has many years of inclusive experience in drawing on blackboards.<p/>

<h2>History</h2>
<p>
The original idea of the game came to Antti on the 28th March 2018. Antti first sketched a game 
in which children would have been killed by the game. Fortunately he got this new idea of a tick. 
Co-creators Hämäläinen and Leisti in the beginning were considerably suspicious. 
After having clarified several facts and made some experimentations and – above all being involved 
in those who had the opportunity to read a tick story by Antti’s mother – Hämäläinen and Leisti 
strongly suggested to execute this: to design a game of a tick’s life.<p/>
<p>The second phase of the enormous game development work, was to gather all possible information 
about ticks, particularly from the tick’s point of view. Plenty of diligent investigation of 
how the tick’s chelicera works, what could a prey animal be, what are the properties of the skin spot, 
where a tick successfully can bite, was carried out.<p/>
<p>Antti insisted on creating preys that move during the procession of the game. 
Joonatan was enthusiastic about putting descriptive colors to text. Merja wanted it just 
to stay as simple as possible – while at home contemporarily drawing coloured pencil 
pictures of a tick and insular landscape.
